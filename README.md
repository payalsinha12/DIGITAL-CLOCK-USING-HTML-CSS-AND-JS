# DIGITAL-CLOCK-USING-HTML-CSS-AND-JS
This project is a digital clock created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays hours, minutes, and seconds, updating in real-time. The design features a modern and vibrant interface with a gradient background. The clock is centered within the viewport and surrounded by colorful circles for aesthetic appeal. Each time unit (hours, minutes, seconds) is displayed in large font size, and labels ("HOURS", "MINS", "SEC") are provided below for clarity.
